# Activity Tracker

The activity tracker uses .json data to catogorize time spent on different activities such as; work, play, study etc.
It has 3 button that you can press to change the overview from daily to weekly or monthly and view your statistics. 
This also compares time spent on these activities from the previous day, week or month. 

## Front-end Mentor

This exercise was a challenge on frontendmentor.io which shows the design template in different screen sizes, active states etc.
It also includes the .json data and image files, but apart from that I had to figure out how to make it work myself.
This project is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
